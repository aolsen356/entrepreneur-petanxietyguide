## Email 2: Quick Win (Day 2)

**Subject:** The 90-second calming technique for anxious dogs

**Preview Text:** When your dog is panicking, try this immediately

**Body:**

Hey,

Hope the checklist is helping! Today I want to share a technique that works FAST when your dog is already anxious.

It's called **Deep Pressure Therapy** - and it works in about 90 seconds.

**How It Works:**

Just like weighted blankets calm anxious humans, firm pressure calms anxious dogs. It triggers the parasympathetic nervous system (the "relax" response).

**The Technique:**

1. **Sit or kneel next to your dog**
   - Don't restrain them or trap them
   - Let them move away if they want (most won't)

2. **Place both hands on their chest/shoulders**
   - Firm, steady pressure (not squeezing)
   - Like you're giving a very slow, deep hug
   - Think "calming weight" not "tight grip"

3. **Hold for 60-90 seconds**
   - Breathe slowly and deeply yourself (they'll match your energy)
   - Don't talk or shush them (silence is calming)
   - Maintain steady pressure throughout

4. **Watch for the "sigh"**
   - Most dogs will take a deep breath and sigh within 60-90 seconds
   - That's the nervous system switching to "calm mode"
   - You can release pressure once they sigh

**Why This Works:**

The pressure releases oxytocin (the "bonding hormone") and reduces cortisol (stress hormone). It's the same reason anxiety wraps like ThunderShirts work - but you don't need to buy anything.

**For Cats:**

Cats usually prefer being wrapped in a blanket or towel (burrito-style) rather than direct pressure. Try:
- Wrap them gently in a soft blanket
- Leave their head exposed (not trapped)
- Hold them securely but not tightly
- Same 60-90 second time frame

**Quick Action:**

Practice this technique BEFORE your pet is anxious. Get them used to it during calm moments so they associate it with safety.

Do it once today. Just 90 seconds. See how your pet responds.

**Important:** This works for mild-to-moderate anxiety. For severe panic (self-injury, uncontrollable trembling), you need professional help and possibly medication. Reply if you're dealing with severe anxiety - I'll point you to resources.

## Email 3: Story + Lesson (Day 4)

**Subject:** How I calmed my dog's thunderstorm anxiety in 3 weeks

**Preview Text:** From hiding under the bed to sleeping through storms

**Body:**

Hey,

Quick question: Does your pet freak out during storms?

My rescue dog Max used to shake uncontrollably every time the barometer dropped. He'd hide under the bed, refuse to eat, and sometimes hurt himself trying to escape.

It was heartbreaking to watch.

Here's how we went from "terrified hiding" to "sleeping through storms" in about 3 weeks.

**The Protocol That Worked:**

**Week 1: Daily CBD + Counter-Conditioning**
- Started CBD oil 2x daily (morning and evening)
  - Dosage: 5mg per 10 lbs body weight (Max is 50 lbs = 25mg per dose)
  - Brand: HolistaPet Full-Spectrum CBD (I tested 6 brands, this worked best)
- Played storm sounds at VERY low volume during treat time
  - 10 minutes per day
  - High-value treats (freeze-dried liver) only during the sounds
  - Building positive association: storm sounds = good things

**Week 2: Increase Sound Volume + Add Pressure Wrap**
- Continued CBD 2x daily
- Increased storm sound volume by 20%
- Introduced ThunderShirt (anxiety wrap)
  - Put it on during calm times first (not just during anxiety)
  - Always paired with treats and playtime
  - Goal: Make the shirt itself calming, not a "warning sign"

**Week 3: Real Storm Prep**
- Continued all of the above
- When REAL storms approached:
  - Gave CBD 60 minutes before barometer dropped (I use weather app alerts)
  - Put on ThunderShirt
  - Set up safe space (covered crate, white noise machine)
  - Stayed calm myself (they sense our anxiety)

**The Results:**

First real storm: Max still panted and paced, but didn't hide or hurt himself. HUGE improvement.

Second storm: He stayed in his crate, mild panting, no panic.

Third storm: He barely reacted. Stayed on the couch.

Now (6 months later): He sleeps through most storms.

**Why This Worked:**

It wasn't just ONE thing - it was the COMBINATION:
- CBD reduced baseline anxiety (took the edge off)
- Counter-conditioning changed his emotional response to storm sounds
- Anxiety wrap provided physical comfort during events
- Consistent safe space gave him control (he could choose to hide)
- My calm energy signaled "we're safe"

**Quick Action:**

You don't need to do all of this at once. Start with the EASIEST thing:

**Option A: Get CBD oil**
- Start with a 2-week supply
- Give daily for consistent anxiety reduction
- See my product recommendations here: [link to products page]

**Option B: Download storm sounds**
- YouTube: Search "thunderstorm sounds"
- Play at low volume during meal times
- Gradually increase volume over 2-3 weeks

**Option C: Set up safe space**
- Covered crate or closet
- Familiar bedding with your scent (old t-shirt)
- White noise machine or fan
- Make it available 24/7 (not just during storms)

Pick ONE. Start today.

**For Severe Cases:**

If your pet is injuring themselves, having accidents from fear, or showing extreme panic, talk to your vet about:
- Prescription anti-anxiety medication (Trazodone, Sileo)
- Working with a veterinary behaviorist
- Short-term sedation for severe events

Anxiety this severe is a medical issue, not a training problem.

Reply if you need help - I'll guide you through it.

## Email 4: Product Recommendation (Day 7)

**Subject:** I tested 8 CBD brands - here's what actually works

**Preview Text:** Honest reviews (no BS) of the best calming products for anxious pets

**Body:**

Hey,

Last email I shared how CBD helped my dog Max. Today I'm sharing exactly WHICH products worked - and which were a waste of money.

**Full transparency: I earn a small commission if you buy through these links. But I only recommend products I've actually used and would give to my own pets.**

---

**Best Overall: HolistaPet Full-Spectrum CBD Oil**

**What I like:**
- Fast-acting (works in 30-45 minutes)
- Multiple potencies (300mg to 3000mg bottles)
- Transparent third-party testing (COA on every batch)
- Bacon flavor dogs actually like
- Subscribe & save option (15% off)

**Dosage:**
- Mild anxiety: 1mg per 10 lbs (e.g., 50 lb dog = 5mg)
- Moderate anxiety: 3mg per 10 lbs
- Severe anxiety: 5mg per 10 lbs
- Give 2x daily for baseline anxiety, or 60 min before stressful event

**Price:** $50-130 depending on bottle size

[HolistaPet Link - Amazon Affiliate kcwd-20]

**Why it beat the others:** Consistent quality, fast results, and my dog actually takes it willingly (some taste terrible).

---

**Best Budget Option: Honest Paws CBD Treats**

**What I like:**
- Easier than oil (just a treat)
- Good for picky eaters
- L-theanine + CBD combo (double calming effect)
- Chewy texture dogs love
- Still affordable ($30-40 per bag)

**What to know:**
- Takes 45-60 min to work (slower than oil)
- Less precise dosing than oil
- Great for planned events (vet visits, car rides)

**Price:** $30-40 per bag (30 treats)

[Honest Paws Link - Amazon Affiliate kcwd-20]

**When to use this instead of oil:** If your pet hates droppers or spits out oil. The treat format is much easier.

---

**Best Anxiety Wrap: ThunderShirt Classic**

**What I like:**
- Actually works (not a gimmick)
- Adjustable fit (measure carefully)
- Machine washable
- Works for dogs AND cats (different versions)
- 45-day money-back guarantee

**How to use:**
- Put it on BEFORE anxiety starts (when barometer drops, not when they're already panicking)
- Should be snug but not tight (you should fit 2 fingers under it)
- Practice during calm times first (pair with treats)
- Can wear for hours during events

**Price:** $40-50 depending on size

[ThunderShirt Link - Amazon Affiliate kcwd-20]

**Why it works:** Deep pressure therapy (same as my 90-second technique from Email 2, but hands-free).

---

**Best Pheromone Solution: Adaptil (Dogs) or Feliway (Cats)**

**What I like:**
- Science-backed (mimics mother's calming pheromones)
- 24/7 passive calming (plug in and forget)
- No side effects
- Works for 30 days per refill

**What to know:**
- Takes 7-14 days to see full effect (not instant)
- Best for chronic anxiety, not acute events
- Use in room where pet spends most time

**Price:** $25 for diffuser + $15-20 per monthly refill

[Adaptil Link - Amazon Affiliate kcwd-20]
[Feliway Link - Amazon Affiliate kcwd-20]

**When to use:** Separation anxiety, multi-pet households, chronic stress.

---

**Products I Tested That DIDN'T Work:**

❌ **Generic "calming chews" from pet stores** - Underdosed, inconsistent
❌ **CBD brands without third-party testing** - No way to verify potency or purity
❌ **Melatonin-only products** - Helped with sleep but not anxiety
❌ **Cheap anxiety wraps from Amazon** - Didn't stay on, poor fit

**Save your money and stick with proven brands.**

---

**Quick Action:**

If you haven't tried CBD yet, start with **HolistaPet 300mg bottle** ($50). It's enough for a 2-3 week trial for most dogs.

Order now so you have it BEFORE the next stressful event. Don't wait until your pet is panicking.

**Dosing Guide:**

| Pet Weight | Starting Dose | Moderate Anxiety | Severe Anxiety |
|------------|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| Under 10 lbs | 2-5 mg | 5-8 mg | 8-12 mg |
| 10-25 lbs | 5-10 mg | 10-15 mg | 15-20 mg |
| 25-50 lbs | 10-15 mg | 15-25 mg | 25-35 mg |
| 50-75 lbs | 15-25 mg | 25-35 mg | 35-50 mg |
| Over 75 lbs | 25-35 mg | 35-50 mg | 50-75 mg |

Give 2x daily (morning and evening) for best results.

**Common Questions I Get:**

**Q: "How do I know if it's anxiety or a medical issue?"**

A: **See a vet if your pet has:**
- Sudden personality change (was calm, now anxious)
- Physical symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite for 24+ hours)
- Self-injury (broken teeth, torn nails from panic)
- Extreme lethargy or unresponsiveness
- Pale gums or difficulty breathing

**Anxiety is behavioral.** If there are physical symptoms, rule out medical causes first.

**Q: "Can I give my pet Benadryl for anxiety?"**

A: **Only if your vet approves.**

Benadryl (diphenhydramine) can help mild anxiety in dogs, but:
- Dosage: 1mg per 1 lb body weight (e.g., 25 lb dog = 25mg)
- Side effects: Drowsiness, dry mouth
- NOT safe for all dogs (heart conditions, glaucoma, etc.)
- **Never give to cats without vet approval**

CBD is safer and more effective for most pets. But if Benadryl is what you have on hand for an emergency, it can help.

**Q: "My dog is anxious 24/7. Will this stuff help?"**

A: Chronic, severe anxiety needs professional help.

See your vet about:
- Daily anti-anxiety medication (Prozac, Reconcile)
- Veterinary behaviorist consultation (find one at DACVB.org)
- Underlying medical issues (thyroid, pain, cognitive decline)

CBD and training help mild-to-moderate anxiety. Severe cases need medical intervention.

---

**When to Call the Vet IMMEDIATELY:**

- Pet is trembling uncontrollably for 2+ hours
- Drooling excessively or vomiting
- Self-injury (trying to break out of crate, tearing nails)
- Unresponsive or lethargic after calming medication
- Breathing rapidly with pale or blue gums

**These are medical emergencies. Call your vet or emergency clinic right away.**
