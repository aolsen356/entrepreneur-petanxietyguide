            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Understanding the root causes helps you target your training more effectively. Puppy anxiety typically stems from four main sources:

                    <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">
                        Some breeds and bloodlines are more prone to anxiety. If your puppy's parents were anxious, your puppy may have inherited that tendency. This doesn't mean it can't be improved - just that consistent training is essential.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">
                        Puppies separated from their mother before 8 weeks, those from puppy mills, or those with traumatic early experiences often develop anxiety. Early weaning disrupts emotional development.
                    </p>

                        Puppies not exposed to various people, animals, sounds, and environments during the critical period (3-14 weeks) often become fearful of novel experiences as adults.

                    <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">
                        A single scary experience - a loud noise, aggressive dog encounter, or rough handling - can create lasting anxiety, especially during the fear imprint periods (8-11 weeks and 6-14 months).

                Master these five foundational techniques before starting the 4-week protocol. They form the building blocks of all anxiety training.

            <!-- Technique 1: Counter-Conditioning -->
            <div class="bg-white rounded-xl p-6 shadow-sm border mb-6">
                <div class="flex items-center mb-4">

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900">Counter-Conditioning</h3>
                </div>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    The most powerful anxiety-reduction technique. You're teaching your puppy to associate scary things with positive experiences.
                </p>
                <div class="bg-green-50 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4">
                    <p class="text-green-800 font-medium mb-2">How it works:</p>
                    <p class="text-green-700 text-sm">Scary stimulus appears = Delicious treat appears</p>
                    <p class="text-green-700 text-sm mt-1">Over time: Scary stimulus = Anticipation of good things</p>
                </div>
                <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">
                    <strong>Example:</strong> If your puppy fears the vacuum, turn it on in another room (low intensity) and immediately give high-value treats. The vacuum sound becomes a predictor of chicken!
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Technique 2: Desensitization -->
            <div class="bg-white rounded-xl p-6 shadow-sm border mb-6">
                <div class="flex items-center mb-4">

                </div>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    Slowly increasing exposure to triggers at levels your puppy can handle without panicking.
                </p>
                <div class="bg-blue-50 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4">
                    <p class="text-blue-800 font-medium mb-2">The key principle:</p>
                    <p class="text-blue-700 text-sm">Stay BELOW the threshold where your puppy reacts. If they're cowering, you've gone too fast.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">
                    <strong>Example:</strong> For dog-reactive puppies, start practicing at 100 feet from other dogs. Only move closer when your puppy stays relaxed at the current distance.
                </p>
            </div>

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    Use a consistent marker word ("Yes!") or clicker to pinpoint exactly when your puppy does something right.

                <div class="bg-purple-50 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4">

                        <li>1. Say "Yes!" (or click)</li>

                    <p class="text-red-800 text-sm">The #1 mistake. If your puppy is showing fear responses (cowering, trembling, refusing treats), you've pushed too hard. Back up to an easier level.</p>

                    <p class="text-red-800 text-sm">Yelling, corrections, or punishment ALWAYS worsens anxiety. It confirms to your puppy that scary things lead to bad outcomes.</p>

                    <p class="text-red-800 text-sm">Forcing your puppy to "face their fears" at full intensity can cause lasting trauma. Always work at sub-threshold levels.</p>

                    <p class="text-red-800 text-sm">Training once a week won't work. Anxious puppies need daily practice. Short, frequent sessions beat long, sporadic ones.</p>

                    <p class="text-red-800 text-sm">Don't give treats when your puppy is actively panicking - this can reinforce the panic behavior. Wait for a calm moment, then reward.</p>

                    <p class="text-red-800 text-sm">Jumping straight to exposure work without building trust and communication first sets you up for failure.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">9. Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <div class="space-y-4">
                <div class="bg-white rounded-lg p-6 shadow-sm border">
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">At what age should I start training my anxious puppy?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Start as early as 8 weeks old. The critical socialization window is 3-14 weeks, making this the optimal time to build confidence and prevent lifelong anxiety issues. Early training during this period shapes your puppy's emotional responses for life.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="bg-white rounded-lg p-6 shadow-sm border">
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">How long does it take to train an anxious puppy?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Most puppies show significant improvement within 4-8 weeks of consistent training. However, deeply anxious puppies may require 3-6 months of dedicated work. The key is consistency rather than speed - rushing can worsen anxiety.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="bg-white rounded-lg p-6 shadow-sm border">
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What is the best training method for anxious puppies?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Counter-conditioning combined with gradual desensitization is the gold standard for anxious puppies. This involves pairing scary stimuli with positive experiences (treats, play) while gradually increasing exposure. Never use punishment-based methods, which worsen anxiety.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="bg-white rounded-lg p-6 shadow-sm border">
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Should I comfort my anxious puppy or ignore them?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">You should comfort your puppy calmly. The outdated advice to ignore fearful behavior has been debunked. Calm reassurance does NOT reinforce fear. However, avoid dramatic reactions - stay calm and matter-of-fact while providing comfort.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="bg-white rounded-lg p-6 shadow-sm border">
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Can anxious puppies grow out of their anxiety?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Without intervention, most anxious puppies do NOT grow out of their anxiety - it often worsens. However, with proper training and socialization during the critical period (8-14 weeks), most puppies can develop into confident adult dogs.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="bg-white rounded-lg p-6 shadow-sm border">
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What products help with puppy anxiety training?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Helpful products include Adaptil diffusers (synthetic calming pheromones), ThunderShirts (compression wraps), KONG toys for positive associations, high-value training treats, and white noise machines. These complement but don't replace behavioral training.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">When should I hire a professional trainer for my anxious puppy?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Consult a certified professional (CPDT-KA, CAAB, or veterinary behaviorist) if your puppy shows aggression, extreme panic, doesn't improve after 4-6 weeks of consistent training, or if anxiety significantly impacts quality of life.</p>
