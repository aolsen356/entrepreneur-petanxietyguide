            <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Cats are masters at hiding their emotions. In the wild, showing weakness could make them targets for predators, so our domestic cats have inherited this instinct to mask their feelings. This means <strong>your cat could be stressed without you even realizing it</strong>.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Here's something that might surprise you: <strong>indoor cats often experience more stress than outdoor cats</strong>. Limited territory, lack of mental stimulation, and multi-cat household dynamics can all contribute to chronic feline anxiety. The key is learning to recognize the subtle signs.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">What Causes Stress in Cats?</h2>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Cats are creatures of habit who value routine and territory above almost everything else. Common stress triggers include:</p>

            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Environmental changes</strong> - Moving, new furniture, renovations</li>
                <li><strong>New family members</strong> - Babies, partners, roommates, other pets</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-cat conflicts</strong> - Competition for resources and territory (see our <a href="multi-cat-household-stress.html" class="text-primary hover:underline">multi-cat stress guide</a>)</li>
                <li><strong>Loud noises</strong> - Construction, parties, thunderstorms</li>
                <li><strong>Routine disruptions</strong> - Changed feeding times, owner's new schedule</li>
                <li><strong>Medical issues</strong> - Pain or illness can manifest as stress behaviors</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">The 8 Warning Signs Your Cat Is Stressed</h2>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">1. Hiding More Than Usual</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                All cats hide sometimes - it's normal behavior. But if your usually social cat has started spending hours under the bed or in closets, refusing to come out even for food or treats, stress may be the cause. A stressed cat seeks safety in isolation.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">2. Over-Grooming or Hair Loss</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Cats groom when they're stressed - it's a self-soothing behavior. But excessive grooming can lead to bald patches, especially on the belly, inner legs, or paws. This condition, called "psychogenic alopecia," is a clear sign your cat is struggling emotionally.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">3. Changes in Eating Habits</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Has your cat suddenly lost interest in food? Or maybe they're eating much more than usual? Both extremes can indicate stress. A cat who skips meals for more than 24 hours should see a vet, as this can quickly become dangerous.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">4. Urinating Outside the Litter Box</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                This is one of the most common and frustrating signs of feline stress. If your cat suddenly starts urinating on furniture, beds, or laundry - especially near doors or windows - it's often a territorial stress response. (Always rule out urinary tract issues with your vet first.)
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">5. Aggression or Irritability</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                A stressed cat may become unexpectedly aggressive - hissing, swatting, or biting when touched. If your normally sweet cat has become "moody" or reactive, don't take it personally. They're telling you something is wrong.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">6. Excessive Vocalization</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Stressed cats may meow, yowl, or cry more than usual, especially at night. This can be particularly pronounced in senior cats experiencing cognitive changes. The vocalization is often a call for reassurance.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">7. Decreased Activity or Lethargy</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                While cats do sleep 12-16 hours a day, a stressed cat may sleep even more or show little interest in play, exploration, or interaction. If your normally curious cat has become a "bump on a log," stress could be the culprit.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">8. Scratching More Than Usual</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Cats scratch to mark territory and relieve stress. If your cat has suddenly increased their scratching - especially on new surfaces or near windows and doors - they may be trying to establish security in their territory.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">How to Help a Stressed Cat</h2>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Once you've identified that your cat is stressed, there are many effective ways to help them feel more secure:
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">Environmental Enrichment</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Vertical space</strong> - Cat trees, shelves, and perches give cats control over their environment</li>
                <li><strong>Hiding spots</strong> - Cardboard boxes, covered beds, and cat caves provide security</li>
                <li><strong>Window access</strong> - "Cat TV" (watching birds) provides mental stimulation</li>
                <li><strong>Interactive play</strong> - Daily play sessions burn off anxious energy</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">Calming Products</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Feliway diffusers</strong> - Release synthetic feline facial pheromones that signal safety. See our <a href="feliway-vs-adaptil.html" class="text-primary hover:underline">Feliway vs Adaptil comparison</a></li>
                <li><strong>CBD oil for cats</strong> - May help reduce anxiety without sedation</li>
                <li><strong>Calming treats</strong> - Often contain L-theanine or chamomile</li>
                <li><strong>Thundershirts</strong> - Gentle compression can have calming effects on some cats. Learn more in our <a href="anxiety-vests-thundershirts.html" class="text-primary hover:underline">anxiety vest guide</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">Multi-Cat Household Tips</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>One litter box per cat, plus one</strong> - Prevents resource guarding</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple feeding stations</strong> - Reduces mealtime competition</li>
                <li><strong>Separate territories</strong> - Each cat needs their own "safe zone"</li>
                <li><strong>Slow introductions</strong> - For new cats, take weeks, not days</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">When to See a Vet</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Always consult your veterinarian if your cat's behavior changes suddenly. Many stress-like symptoms can also indicate medical problems. Your vet can rule out health issues and, if needed, prescribe anti-anxiety medication for severe cases. Read our guide on <a href="when-to-see-vet-anxiety.html" class="text-primary hover:underline">when to see a vet for pet anxiety</a>.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Every cat responds to stress differently. Some show one or two subtle signs; others display multiple obvious symptoms. Understanding your individual cat's stress signals helps you intervene early, before anxiety becomes chronic.
