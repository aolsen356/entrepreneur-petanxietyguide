Anxiety-driven behavior typically happens in response to specific triggers (being left alone, loud noises, new environments), often includes physical symptoms (panting, trembling), and the dog appears distressed rather than playful. Misbehavior is usually opportunistic, happens when the dog is relaxed, and stops with training. If destruction only happens when you're gone and your dog seems stressed at your departure, that's anxiety."

                Did you know that <strong>72.5% of dogs exhibit some form of anxiety-related behavior</strong>? That's nearly 3 out of every 4 dogs. If you've noticed your furry friend acting differently lately, they might be trying to tell you something important.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Dog anxiety is more common than most pet owners realize. Whether triggered by loud noises, separation from their humans, or changes in routine, anxiety can significantly impact your dog's quality of life. The good news? Once you recognize the signs, there are many effective ways to help.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">The 10 Most Common Signs of Dog Anxiety</h2>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">1. Excessive Barking or Whining</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                When left alone, anxious dogs often vocalize their distress. This isn't just normal barking - it's persistent, high-pitched, and may continue for hours. Neighbors often notice before owners do.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">2. Destructive Behavior</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Chewing furniture, scratching doors, destroying shoes - anxious dogs often become destructive, especially when left alone. This isn't spite; it's a coping mechanism for overwhelming stress.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">3. Pacing or Restlessness</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Does your dog walk in circles or pace back and forth? This repetitive behavior is a classic anxiety sign. Some dogs do this when they sense something stressful is coming (like you leaving for work).
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">4. Trembling or Shaking</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Shaking during thunderstorms or fireworks is well-known, but anxious dogs may tremble in many situations - at the vet, in the car, or when meeting new people.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">5. Excessive Drooling or Panting</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Heavy panting when it's not hot, or drooling more than usual, can indicate stress. This is your dog's body going into "fight or flight" mode.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">6. House Accidents Despite Being Trained</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                If your house-trained dog suddenly starts having accidents indoors, anxiety could be the cause. Stress affects bladder control and can override years of training.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">7. Escape Attempts</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Anxious dogs may desperately try to escape from yards, crates, or rooms. This can lead to injuries as they scratch at doors, dig under fences, or jump barriers.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">8. Changes in Appetite</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Some anxious dogs lose interest in food entirely, while others stress-eat. If your dog's eating habits have changed without a medical reason, anxiety might be involved.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">9. Excessive Licking or Grooming</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Compulsive licking of paws, legs, or other body parts is a self-soothing behavior. Over time, this can lead to hair loss and skin irritation.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">10. Aggression or Irritability</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Anxiety can make even the friendliest dog become snappy or aggressive. If your normally calm dog has become reactive, underlying anxiety may be the cause.
            </p>
