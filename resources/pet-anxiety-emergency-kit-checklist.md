### Calming Techniques

- **Slow blinks** (for cats) - Signal safety
- **Gentle massage** - Ears, chest, shoulders
- **Deep pressure therapy** - Calm, firm hugs (if pet accepts)
- **"Find it" games** - Scatter treats to distract
- **Obedience cues** - Sit, down, touch (engages thinking brain)

### What NOT to Do

- ❌ Punish anxious behavior (it's not misbehavior)
- ❌ Force pet into safe space (let them choose)
- ❌ Overly comfort whining (reinforces anxiety)
- ❌ Leave anxious pet alone
- ❌ Give medication without testing first
